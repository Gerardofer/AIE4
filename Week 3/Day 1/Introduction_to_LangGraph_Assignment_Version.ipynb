        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model alone might not have enough information to produce a high-quality response, such as in open-domain question answering, dialogue systems, and other applications requiring access to a large knowledge base. By combining retrieval and generation, RAG can leverage the strengths of both approaches to improve overall performance.\""

              "   'output': \"A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a type of artificial intelligence model that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. Here's a breakdown of the components and how they work together:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval Component**: This part of the system is responsible for fetching relevant information from a large corpus of documents or a database. It uses techniques from information retrieval to find documents or passages that are most relevant to the input query or context.\\n\\n2. **Generation Component**: This part of the system is typically a language model (like GPT-3) that generates text based on the input it receives. In the context of a RAG system, the generation component uses the information retrieved by the retrieval component to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\\n\\n### How RAG Works\\n\\n1. **Input Query**: The system receives an input query or prompt from the user.\\n2. **Retrieval Phase**: The retrieval component searches a large corpus to find documents or passages that are relevant to the query.\\n3. **Augmentation Phase**: The retrieved information is then used to augment the input query. This augmented input provides additional context and information to the generation component.\\n4. **Generation Phase**: The generation component uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context from the retrieval phase helps the model produce more accurate and informative text.\\n\\n### Benefits of RAG\\n\\n- **Improved Accuracy**: By leveraging external information, the system can provide more accurate and relevant responses.\\n- **Contextual Relevance**: The retrieval component ensures that the generated text is grounded in real-world information, making it more contextually appropriate.\\n- **Scalability**: RAG systems can handle large corpora of information, making them suitable for applications like question answering, customer support, and more.\\n\\n### Applications\\n\\n- **Question Answering**: Providing accurate answers to user queries by retrieving relevant documents and generating responses based on them.\\n- **Customer Support**: Assisting customer service agents by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and generating helpful responses.\\n- **Content Creation**: Aiding in the creation of articles, reports, and other content by retrieving relevant information and generating coherent text.\\n\\nOverall, RAG systems represent a powerful approach to combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to produce high-quality, contextually relevant text.\",\n",
