            "\n",
            "### 1. Use `for` loop for Iteration:\n",
            "If you want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string), using a `for` loop is often the best approach.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "example_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
            "for item in example_list:\n",
            "    print(item)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Use `while` loop for Condition-based Repetition:\n",
            "If you need to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true, a `while` loop is appropriate.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "counter = 0\n",
            "while counter < 5:\n",
            "    print(counter)\n",
            "    counter += 1\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Avoid Infinite Loops:\n",
            "Always ensure there's a condition that will eventually terminate a `while` loop to prevent infinite loops.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. Use `enumerate()` for Index Tracking:\n",
            "If you need both the index and the value from a sequence, use `enumerate()`.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",

            "    print(index, fruit)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 5. Use List Comprehensions for Simple Loops:\n",
            "For simple transformations on lists, consider using list comprehensions for concise and readable code.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
